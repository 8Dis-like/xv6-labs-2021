# xv6-labs-2021

This repository contains my implementations of the lab assignments from MIT’s 6.S081: Operating System Engineering (Fall 2021), using the xv6 teaching operating system — a minimalist Unix-like kernel developed for educational purposes.

To maintain clarity and modularity, each lab is developed in a **separate Git branch**, following the official course structure:  
🔗 [MIT 6.S081 (2020) Lab Schedule](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/schedule.html)

All work was developed and tested in an **Ubuntu 22.04** environment.

### Topics Covered
- System call interface and user/kernel boundaries  
- Process lifecycle, scheduling policies, and system utilities  
- Virtual memory management with lazy allocation and page replacement  
- File system implementation and disk I/O  
- Synchronization primitives, threads, and concurrency

This structured, branch-per-lab approach allows future developers to:
- Cleanly isolate each lab’s logic  
- Easily switch between topics using Git  
- Build, test, and debug labs independently

This repository is intended solely for educational use and adheres closely to the official materials and guidelines provided by MIT.
